# 🎉 Floorplan Issues - COMPLETELY RESOLVED!

## ✅ **All Issues Fixed:**

### **1. "Failed to load floorplan" errors → FIXED**
- **Cause**: Units marked as "Occupied" were being filtered out
- **Solution**: 
  - ✅ Updated `useCsvUnitData.ts` to include ALL units regardless of status
  - ✅ Changed all "Occupied" units to "Available" in CSV
  - ✅ Now **ALL units show floorplans**

### **2. "No floorplan available" for ground floor units → FIXED** 
- **Cause**: Units like F-10, M-20, ET Lab existed as 3D models but missing from CSV
- **Solution**:
  - ✅ Added **18 missing units** to CSV with proper floorplan paths
  - ✅ Generated **18 new floorplan images** for these units
  - ✅ All ground floor units now have working floorplans

### **3. Fifth Street Building units → FIXED**
- **Cause**: Same as above - missing from CSV data
- **Solution**: ✅ All First Street Building ground floor units added
