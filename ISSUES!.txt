im going to list off some issues we have

for some reason, the only units that actually change their material status correctly and show the nice blue transparent material are the units within "C:\Users\drews\OneDrive\Documents\OFFICIAL_LA_CENTER\threejs-visualizer-\project\public\models\boxes\First Street Building"
"C:\Users\drews\OneDrive\Documents\OFFICIAL_LA_CENTER\threejs-visualizer-\project\public\models\boxes\Maryland Building" ... the rest of the units do not display the proper blue translucent material. we must resolve this by ensuring every unit displays the same blue material when clicked on. the second issue is when the folders within the explore units tab are clicked on, the units within those folders should also switch their material to blue. right now - when i click a folder for example this one "C:\Users\drews\OneDrive\Documents\OFFICIAL_LA_CENTER\threejs-visualizer-\project\public\models\boxes\Maryland Building\Ground Floor" - in the environment i sese the units displayed but they do not display the right color they show gray, or no material...  when i click any of the folders int he "explore Units" tab, every unit living within that folder either directly or within folders within that selected folder, every unit should change its color to light blue. If we make all of these changes then i will be able to see all the units in Maryland Building, or all the units in Fifth street building or all the units on floor two of fifth street building... i should be able to navigate my 3d scene while having the "explore units" menu open as well. this means when I have the "explore units" menu open and i click out into my 3d scene the menu should stay open, the only way to collapse the menu would be to click the "X" button on the top right of the menu that when clicked exits out the menu. I also noticed an issue with the building folders being called "Building First Street Building". We dont want to have the extra word "building" before the name. it should just be "First Street Building". this goes for all of the other folders Maryland Building, Other, Stages, Tower Building. Make sure that the GLB's representing the units either show their invisible state or the light up blue state. they should never be caught displaying the flat white color.... the search bar in the explore units tab also isn't relevant. instead of  search bar we should be have a filter for square footage, which will have a slider to slide between square footage ranges for max square footage and min square footage. we should also be able to check mark which kind of building we want to view, either office, stages, or event space. this should affect the units displayed in the menu for explore units actively and live... when we see our units in the folder it shows other red text to the right that says "unknown", that text should be removed and doesn't need to be there. instead we should have the square footage of the space listed so we can see the square footage.  the overall look of the Ui for Explore units needs to be redefined as well it needs to feel more minimal and simple and the white background should be transparent. it should feel less bulky, and it should really resemble more of our other tab within the program representing the "Camera Controls".. also the camera controls tab, needs to be flattened out on the bottom row. currently we have the rotation controls above the zoom controls above the reset view button. in reality this should be hosted side by side at the bottom but slightly raised from the bottom to prevent being cut off in view of some devices. the explore units tab needs some help with the design. it should be moved from the top of the screen to the bottom as well side by side with camera controls but more of a larger horizontal tab. the menu should rise up from the bottom up and rise up revealing the untis with smooth animation. the opening and closing of the folders should also have smooth animations that reveal the contents and hide the contents smoothly. when we hover over each unit in the explore units there should be a pop out of a ow res image of the floorplan for that unit. this should be quick and show easily the png for the floor plan. when we hover over units as well the unit name text block within the explore units should highlight to show we are hovering. when we click it it should stay highlighted to signify we are looking at it. when we click it a text should also appear to the side of the unit name saing "show details" clicking show details brings up a pop up window with the details for the unit! this should include square footage and a summary. this should also mainly show the floor plan. all the text for the unit in the details page is at the bottom. the details page should also have a share button sharing users to that specific unit with a specific url. all the details for all of the units should be sourced from our google sheets! our google sheets should be the one to host all that data and we retrieve it. for now if its not hooked up to a google sheets just use a placeholder for all of them but make sure we can easily switch that out when we get the google sheets hooked up. our 3d scene also needs updating, it needs to implement nice shadows and also implement good lighting. i need my scene to be able to handle me switching out updated versions of our files and have it all update in the code instantly without having to adjust anything. so if i need to replace a model with an updated one i can just replace the actual file in the codebase and it will update in the scene perfectly.  the white fog in the scene needs to be lowered in intensity sort of...
